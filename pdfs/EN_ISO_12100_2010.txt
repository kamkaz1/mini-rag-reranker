        EN ISO 12100:2010 - Safety of machinery - General principles for design - Risk assessment and risk reduction
        
        This standard provides general principles for the design of machinery and guidance for risk assessment and risk reduction.
        It establishes a systematic approach to machinery safety.
        
        The risk assessment process includes:
        1. Determination of the limits of the machinery
        2. Hazard identification
        3. Risk estimation
        4. Risk evaluation
        5. Risk reduction
        
        Risk reduction follows the three-step method:
        1. Inherently safe design measures
        2. Safeguarding and/or complementary protective measures
        3. Information for use
        
        Key principles:
        - Safety by design is the most effective approach
        - Risk assessment should be iterative
        - Residual risks must be communicated to users
        - Safety measures should not create new hazards
