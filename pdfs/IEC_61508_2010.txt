        IEC 61508:2010 - Functional safety of electrical/electronic/programmable electronic safety-related systems
        
        This standard provides a generic approach for all safety lifecycle activities for systems that are used to perform safety functions.
        It covers the safety lifecycle from initial concept through decommissioning.
        
        The standard defines four safety integrity levels (SIL 1 to SIL 4), where SIL 4 represents the highest level of safety integrity.
        Each SIL has specific requirements for:
        - Hardware safety integrity
        - Systematic safety integrity
        - Software safety integrity
        
        Key concepts include:
        - Safety function: Function to be implemented by an E/E/PE safety-related system
        - Safety integrity: Probability of a safety-related system satisfactorily performing the required safety functions
        - Safety lifecycle: All activities necessary to achieve functional safety
