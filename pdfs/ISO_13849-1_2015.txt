        ISO 13849-1:2015 - Safety of machinery - Safety-related parts of control systems
        
        This international standard specifies safety requirements for safety-related parts of control systems. 
        It provides guidance on the design and integration of safety-related parts of control systems.
        
        The standard defines performance levels (PL) from PLa to PLe, where PLe represents the highest level of safety integrity.
        Performance levels are determined based on the combination of safety integrity level (SIL) and mean time to dangerous failure (MTTFd).
        
        Key requirements include:
        - Systematic capability (SC) requirements
        - Hardware fault tolerance (HFT) requirements  
        - Diagnostic coverage (DC) requirements
        - Common cause failure (CCF) requirements
        
        The standard applies to safety-related parts of control systems that are used to perform safety functions.
