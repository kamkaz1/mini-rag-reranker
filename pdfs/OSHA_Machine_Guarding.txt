        Machine guarding is essential for protecting workers from machine hazards. OSHA requires that machines be guarded to prevent worker injury.
        
        Types of machine guards include:

        - Interlocked guards: Guards that automatically shut off the machine when opened
        - Adjustable guards: Guards that can be adjusted for different operations
        - Self-adjusting guards: Guards that move with the work piece
        
        General requirements:
        - Guards must prevent contact with moving parts
        - Guards must be secure and not create new hazards
        - Guards must allow for safe operation and maintenance
        - Emergency stop devices must be readily accessible
        
        Common machine hazards include:
        - Point of operation hazards
        - In-running nip point hazards
        - Rotating parts hazards
        - Flying chips and sparks
